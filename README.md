# DEGauss Official Website

This is the official website for DEGauss - Dynamic-Static Decomposition with Gaussian Splatting for Distractor-free 3D Reconstruction.

## About DEGauss

DEGauss is a cutting-edge computer vision framework that revolutionizes 3D scene reconstruction through dynamic-static decomposition using Gaussian splatting techniques. Our technology enables robust 3D reconstruction in challenging environments with dynamic objects and distractors.

## Features

- **Advanced 3D Reconstruction**: State-of-the-art Gaussian splatting technology
- **Dynamic-Static Decomposition**: Intelligent separation of dynamic and static elements
- **Distractor-Free Processing**: Robust handling of distractors and noise
- **Egocentric Data Support**: Specialized algorithms for first-person perspective data
- **High Performance**: Optimized algorithms for real-time processing
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs and comprehensive documentation

## Installation

### Python Package
```bash
pip install degauss
```

### Conda
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge degauss
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BatFaceWayne/DeGauss.git
cd DeGauss
pip install -e .
```

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- OpenCV 4.5+
- PyTorch 1.9+

## Quick Start

```python
import degauss

# Initialize DEGauss
model = degauss.DeGaussModel()

# Load your data
data = degauss.load_data("path/to/your/data")

# Process the scene
result = model.process(data)

# Extract reconstructed scene
scene = result.get_scene()
```
